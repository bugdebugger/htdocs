      Pingus has started at the end of 1998 with the simple goal to
      create a Free (as in freedom, not as in free beer)
      Lemmings<sup>tm</sup> clone. The <em>Free</em> means you get the
      sources and are allowed and encouraged to change and distribute
      them. You basically get everything that I used to create this
      game. In the years it has grown than quite a bit over the
      original goal and become something more than just a clone, we
      have original artwork, a built-in level editor, new actions,
      multiplayer and a few other features.

      If you don't know Lemmings<sup>tm</sup>, here comes a short
      introduction. It is a puzzle game developed in 1991
      by <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/company/sheet/companyId,146/">DMA
        Design</a>. The player takes command in the game of a bunch of
      small animals and has to guide them through levels. Since the
      animals walk on their own, the player can only influence them by
      giving them commands, like <em>build a bridge</em>,
      <em>dig a hole</em> or <em>redirect all animals in the other
	direction</em>. The goal of each level is to reach the exit,
      for this multiple combination of commands are necessary.  The
      game is presented in a 2D site view. For more information you
      might want to visit one of the numerous

	fanpages</a> on the net.

      While Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings<sup>tm</sup>, it
      however doesn't try to be an exact clone, it has included a few
      ideas of its own, like the worldmap or secret levels, which
      might be familiar from games the Super Mario World and other
      Nintendo games. It has also a few new actions, like the jumper
      which weren't presented in the original game. To get an
      impression of the look of the Pingus game you might want to have
