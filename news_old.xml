      </item>
      
      <item date="11. Feb 2006">
        Time for some news, current plans for Pingus look like this:

        <ul>
          <li>Jave27 is currently trying to get the latest version in a release ready state</li>

          <li>Grumbel opened a new branch in SVN called pingus-sdl, this
            is supposed to port Pingus to SDL, level file format will
            switch to S-Expr instead of XML
          </li>
        </ul>
      </item>

      <item date="09. Apr 2004">
        It's been a long time without any updates, so there's a couple of news to note here.
        <ul>
          <li>Pingus got elected GotM for April at <a href="http://www.happypenguin.org">The Linux Game Tome</a> and a 0.7 release with many new features may be expected soon.</li>
	  <li>Pingus CVS was replaced by <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a></li>
          <li>There will be a new release on the stable branch (0.6.1) very soon now, planned date is 15.04.2004 - cross your fingers and hope. :-)</li>
          <li>We've got now a <a href="http://pingus.seul.org/level_comment_tool/index.php">Level Comment Tool</a> where you can rate all levels which are delivered with Pingus.</li>
        </ul>
      </item>
