    <p>
      Building a level for Pingus is actually very easy with the current
      level editor, but there are still some things that doesn't work
      as they should. This little guide should make sure that
      everything works smooth for you.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section title="Starting from scratch">
    <a href="images/editor_tutorial_editor.jpg"><img

    <p>
      First of launch Pingus and select the large <em>Editor</em>
      button. You are now inside the level editor. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lets start with something simple, insert your first
      object. Press the <tt class="key">Insert</tt> button on your keyboard or on the
      button panel at the left side of the screen. You will now see a
      list of object types you can insert. The letters in front of the
      type names describe the keys you have to press to insert the
      object type. Sorry there is at the moment no mouse support in
      the selection menus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, lets insert a ground piece of type ground, to do that press
      <tt class="key">g</tt>. I'll explain the different ground piece types later
      in this article. After a short loading sequence, you will see a
      list of all the gfx which are available. To
      scroll down the list simply move the mouse to the bottom of the
      screen. Now click on an object to insert it into the level.
    </p>
    <a href="images/editor_tutorial_objsel.jpg"><img
        src="images/editor_tutorial_objsel_small.jpg" alt="Surface Selector" align="right" /></a>
    <p>
      The first ground piece is now in place, you can simply click on
      it and move it around when you hold down the mouse button. To
      duplicate it press <tt class="key">d</tt>. The duplicated object
      will be inserted at the same position as the original object,
      only with a short offset to the bottom/right.<br /> If you want to
      move around the duplicated object, its a good idea to move it a
      bit away from the old object first, so that you don't actually
      select the wrong object. This becomes especially important when
      have grouped some objects. To do that use the cursor keys, hold
      down the shift key to get a faster movement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section title="Entrances">
    <p>
      Now that we have some ground to walk on, we need an entrance to
      let the Pingus enter the level. Hit <tt class="key">insert</tt>
      and <tt class="key">e</tt> for an entrance. You will now
      see a list of entrance types, select the "generic"
      one. After that is done you will see a black arrow with a green
      "G" to its site, that is the entrance or more exactly the
      position where the Pingus can enter the level. The
      "generic" entrance doesn't use any gfx.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section title="Exits">
    <p>
      The Pingus can now enter the level, lets place a exit so that
      they can leave it again. Again press <tt class="key">Insert</tt> and then
      select Exit with <tt class="key">x</tt>. You get the same list of surfaces
      you got when you inserted the ground piece. Select a surface,
      which looks like an exit and place it where the Pingus can reach
      it. Now your done the level should be ready for a test.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section title="Starting the level the first time">
    <a
      href="images/editor_tutorial_level.jpg"><img src="images/editor_tutorial_level_small.jpg"
        alt="Level" align="right" /></a>
    <p>
      Now that the level is basically done, lets start it by pressing
      <tt class="key">F4</tt> or the "Run" key on the
      button panel. The level will than start and you can test it. If
      your are done press <tt class="key">Esc</tt> or wait until the
      level is complete. After testing your level you will come back
      into the level editor.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section title="Saving and loading">
    <p>
      Its a good idea to save the level from time to time, to do that
      press <tt class="key">F6</tt> and enter a file name for it, for
      example <tt class="file">my_test</tt>. Node that the filenames
      <em>must not</em> have an ending like <tt class="file">.plf</tt>
      or <tt class="file">.psm</tt>. The level will than be saved to
      <tt class="file">~/.pingus/levels/my_test.plf</tt> and <tt
        class="file">~/.pingus/levels/my_test.psm</tt><br />

      To load a level press <tt class="key">F5</tt> and input the filename. The
      dialog also has a primitive tab-completion. To use it activate
      the console by pressing <tt class="key">^</tt> and then press
      <tt class="key">Tab</tt>. The completion will go into the console. The tab-completion is currently not fully functional, therefor it will
      only work in the default directory and in <em>no</em> other
      directory.
    </p>

  <section title="Beautifying the level">

    <p>
      You might have noticed that there is still a lot of stuff
      missing in your level. You have an ugly default background and
      your Pingus appeared out of nothing. So lets start to make it a
      little nicer. 
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <h3>Changing the background</h3>
  <p>
    To change the background press <tt class="key">F10</tt> and
    select one of the available backgrounds.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Building an entrance</h3>
  <a href="images/editor_tutorial_entrance.jpg"><img
      src="images/editor_tutorial_entrance_small.jpg" alt="Entrance" align="right" /></a>
  <p>
    The default entrance just adds a position where the Pingus enter
    the level, but no gfx, so that is the next thing to add. To do
    that you have to use hotspots. Hotspots are graphical objects,
    which don't influence the collision map. To add a hotspot, press
    <tt class="key">Insert</tt> and then <tt class="key">h</tt> and select a thing that
    looks like an entrance. You need two surfaces for an entrance,
    one which is behind the Pingus and one that is above the
    Pingus to get a pseudo 3D effect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Select the first hotspot and than lower it below the Pingus
    level which is at z_pos 75. Press <tt class="key">Shift-PgDown</tt> to lower
    the z_pos value to -100, note that you can see the z-pos in the
    status line. <tt class="key">PgDown</tt> itself will not change the
    z-pos, but instead only change the ordering of all objects,
    which have the same z-pos. After your done with the bottom
    hotspots add the top hotspot, to raise it press
    <tt class="key">Shift-PgUp</tt> and bring it to a z-pos value of
    100. Finally adjust the position so that it looks correct.
  </p>

  <h3>Adding some grass</h3>
  <a href="images/editor_tutorial_level2.jpg"><img
      src="images/editor_tutorial_level2_small.jpg" alt="Level (beautified)" align="right" /></a>
  <p>
    Stones alone looks much to simple to be attractive, so lets add
    some grass.<br />Grass is special since it shouldn't influence the
    way the Pingus are walking over the ground, but it should be
    erasable by explosions and diggers or miners, for this reason
    there is the special ground type
    "transparent". Press <tt class="key">Insert</tt> and <tt class="key">n</tt> and
    select a piece of grass and place it over the stones. Try to add some
    more ground pieces, and viola, the level looks much better now.
  </p>

  <h3>Adding lava</h3>
  <p>
    Now you might want to add some lava or water under the stones, but that
    is currently not implemented in the editor, so you have to
    editor the level files directly. Open your level file, which
    should be saved under <tt class="file">~/.pingus/levels/my_test.plf</tt> and
    insert the following text at the end of the file:
  </p>

  <pre>liquid {
    image = (resource)"Liquid/lava";
    x_pos = -40;
    y_pos = 412;
    z_pos = -100;
    width = 1400;
    }

    liquid {
    image = (resource)"Liquid/lava";
    x_pos = -40;
    y_pos = 412;
    z_pos = 100;
    width = 1400;
    }</pre>

  <p>
    If you are done, save the file and reload it into the level
    editor. You will see then some lava floating around. Adjust the
    position of the lava and you are done. Its a good idea to have
    some lava in the background and another lava object on top of
    the level where the position is shifted a bit to the left, that
    will result in a pseudo 3D effect. If the lava is not width
    enough, change the parameter in the level file reload the level
    again.
  </p>

  <h3>Well done</h3>
  <p>
    Now you know the basics of level editing, all that is missing now
    is a good idea for a level. If you have created some levels,
    please mail them to <a href="grumbel@pingus.cx">Ingo Ruhnke</a>
    so that they can go into the next Pingus release.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next part of this tutorial will explain how the level are
    structured, how the objects are ordered and what object types
    exist.
  </p>

  <section title="Level Structure">

    <p>Before I start to explain all the different object types its a
      good idea to understand the map structure of Pingus first.
    </p>
    
    <p>A Pingus level consists of multiple layers of gfx maps and one
      additional layer for the collision detection.<br /> The gfx maps
      consist of one layer for the background and on for the gfx-map,
      that's the ground where you can dig and blast holes in it. The
      rest of the gfx layers are hotspots objects, entrances, exits,
      etc. and the Pingus themselves.</p>
  </section>

  <section title="Z-Pos">

    <p>To influence the ordering of objects you have two
      possibilities, first you can simply lower and raise it with <tt
        class="key">PgUp</tt> and <tt class="key">PgDown</tt>, but that
      will only work inside a layer. For example if you want to raise
      one ground piece above another that's the right way, but if you
      want to lower a hotspot below the ground layer, than that's the
      wrong way. To accomplish that you have to press <tt
        class="key">Shift PgUp</tt> or <tt class="key">Shift PgDown</tt>
      (or <tt class="key">Ctrl</tt>) to change the z-pos of the
      object. If an object its below zero, than it will be draw behind
      the ground layer, if its above 75 it will get drawn above the
      ground map and the Pingus, if an object is between 0 and 75 it
      will be drawn above the ground layer, but behind the Pingus
      layer. So the z-pos describes the ordering of the layers.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section title="Object types">
    <h3>Groundpieces (ground, transparent, solid)</h3>

    <p>Groundpieces are the ground where the Pingus can walk. They are
      they are at runtime combined to a single gfx map and then
      blitted at once. They can have different types, which will
      change the way how they are handled on the collision map.</p>

    <h4>ground</h4>
    <p>
      Normal ground is of type ground, the Pingus can dig through it and
      walk on it and blast it away.
    </p>

    <h4>solid</h4>
    <p>
      Solid ground is like the normal ground, but the Pingus can't dig
      through it. This is meant for metal plates and other stuff which is
      obviously not passable.
    </p>

    <h4>transparent</h4>
    <p>
      Transparent ground pieces are objects, which have no influence on
      the collision map, therefore the Pingus can't walk on it. But
      transparent ground pieces are blitted to the gfx map, so the
      Pingus will remove it if they explode or dig on it. This ground
      type is especially meant for grass or other little gimmicks
      which make a level nice, but which shouldn't have influence of it.
    </p>

    <h4>bridge</h4>
    <p>
      The bridges which a bridger builds are of type ground, the
      special property of the bridge property is that the Pingus can walk through it from 
    </p>
  </section>

  <h3>Hotspots</h3>
  <p>Hotspots are gfx objects which don't get blitted to the gfx
    map, instead they are draw separately. This has the consequences,
    that they can't be digged away and that they can scroll at a
    different speed than the rest of the ground (parallax
    scrolling). Hotspots also have the advantage that they have a
    z-pos, therefore they can be placed above or below the
    Pingus.<br /> Entrances for example consist normally of three
    objects an hotspots for the back side of the entrance, an hotspot
    for the front side of the entrance and an entrance object for
    the middle position.</p>

  <h3>Entrances</h3>
  <p>Entrances are the places where the Pingus enter a level, they
    normally don't draw any gfx, therefore it is required that you
    add some Hotspots above and below them to make them look
    realistic.</p>

  <h3>Exits</h3>
  <p>Exits are similar to hotspots, but they provide first an exit
    point, where the  Pingus can leave a level and second they erase
    an area in the collision map, so that the exit isn't blocked by
    any objects in front of them.</p>

  <h3>Liquids</h3> 
  
  <p>Liquids are things like lava, water or acid. The consist of a
    single image which is blitted multiple times up to a given
    width. In addition to hotspots they also manipulate the collision
    map so that the area is marked as <em>deadly</em>.</p>
