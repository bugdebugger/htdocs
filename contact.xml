    <p>
      If you want to write a longer comment, send patches or similar
      thing, the best way is probably by using the pingus-devel
      mailing lists, subscribe information can be found below, to just
      send a mail to the list write to <a
	href="mailto:pingus-devel@nongnu.org?subject:[non-member]">pingus-devel@nongnu.org</a>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/pingus-devel">pingus-devel</a>
	- Pingus Developer List (for general discussion about the game, the development, etc.).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is currently no pingus-users mailing list due to the lack
      of traffic, so using the pingus-devel list for questions about the
      game is perfectly ok.</p>

  <section title="Bug Reports">
    <p>
      If you want to submit a bug report about Pingus or simply browse
      the list of open bugs, you can do so at
      the <a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/issues">Pingus
      Issue Tracker</a>. Submitting stuff there should make it sure
      that it doesn't get lost.

  <section title="IRC">
    <p>For a quick help you can try the IRC server <tt
      class="irc">irc.freenode.net:6667</tt> and the channel <tt
      class="irc">#pingus</tt>, you can find the project maintainer
      (nick: grumbel) there most of the time. From time to time there
      will also be IRC Meetings with larger parts of the development
      team, once such meetings happen, they will get announced in the
      news section.

      us directly via Instant Messaging.
